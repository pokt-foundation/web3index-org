## Subcategory

## Please provide a description of the protocol. 

## Why do you believe this protocol is a good fit for The Web3 Index?

## Can you describe the protocol's tokenomics?

## Who are the demand and supply side participants in the protocol? Please detail how both participants interact with the protocol.

## Please provide the protocol’s cumulative fees over the past 30- and 90-day periods.

Fees are generally categorized as explicit or implicit.

An example of an explicit fee could be a single payment for work rendered by a protocol. Examples of this would be a payment to query indexed data on The Graph, or a payment to store data on Arweave.

In certain protocols, user/developer stake represents an allotment of usage on the network. If this usage triggers inflation, then the cost to stake for demand side participants is quantified as being equivalent to the dilution incurred as a result of its usage and is categorized as an implicit fee.

Please note a user/developer stake in isolation does not count toward explicit fees unless the staked balance reduces as protocol services are rendered. In this case the spent/burned amount of the staked balance would constitute an explicit fee.
